How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The lines were printed after another so i could compare them by view

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By looking at old versions i can easily undo dead end changes or try out stuff more quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-pro logical places for commits, quite enough versions
-con just shortcut for saving old version

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
For code its usually useful

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log gives you a history of commits, git diff takes 2 commits as params and gives the differences.
