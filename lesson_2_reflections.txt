What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is added. You need to create it to be able to add commits and tracked files to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It offers a place where you find those files being tracked but not commited yet. Its good for a consistent workflow, where you have not settled on the final amount of files being ptracked yet
